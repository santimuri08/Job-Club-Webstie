# Problem Statement & Goals

## Executive Summary

NJIT students interested in AI careers face significant barriers to becoming job-ready. Job Club addresses these challenges through automated onboarding, community support, and structured guidance—turning AI-curious students into career-ready professionals.

---

## The Problem

### Challenge 1: Lack of Structured Guidance

**What's happening:**
- Students don't know which AI career path fits them (ML Engineer? Data Scientist? AI Consultant?)
- Overwhelmed by learning options (courses, bootcamps, YouTube, certifications)
- No clear roadmap from "interested in AI" to "hired in AI"
- Generic career advice doesn't address AI-specific requirements

**Impact:**
- Students waste time on wrong paths
- Analysis paralysis prevents action
- Fall behind peers who have guidance

**Evidence:**
- Career center reports AI as top interest area but lowest placement rate
- Student surveys show "don't know where to start" as #1 barrier

---

### Challenge 2: Incomplete Professional Presence

**What's happening:**
- LinkedIn profiles are empty, outdated, or generic
- GitHub has no meaningful projects (or just class assignments)
- No portfolio website to showcase work
- No Calendly or professional booking system
- Recruiters can't find or evaluate them

**Impact:**
- Invisible to recruiters and hiring managers
- Can't demonstrate skills even if they have them
- Lose opportunities to students with better online presence

**Evidence:**
- 70% of NJIT CS students have incomplete LinkedIn profiles
- Average GitHub has < 5 public repositories
- < 10% have any portfolio website

---

### Challenge 3: Isolation & Lack of Community

**What's happening:**
- Learning AI alone is difficult and demotivating
- No community of peers at similar stage
- Limited access to mentors who've succeeded
- Miss opportunities they don't hear about
- No accountability to stay on track

**Impact:**
- Students lose motivation and quit
- Don't hear about jobs, events, opportunities
- No network for referrals or recommendations

**Evidence:**
- Student retention in AI courses drops 40% by week 8
- Most job placements come through referrals students don't have access to

## The Impact of Inaction

Without addressing these challenges, students:

| Problem | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| No guidance | Choose wrong paths, waste semesters |
| No presence | Miss internship/job opportunities |
| Isolation | Lose motivation, miss referrals |
| No portfolio | Graduate unprepared for AI job market |
| No community | Fall behind peers at other schools |

**Bottom line:** NJIT students have the talent but lack the system to become AI-ready.
