# AI-Generated Harvest Notes (EAiKW)

This file complements `harvest-notes.md` with a distilled checklist of reusable patterns.

## Reusable patterns to apply

- Consistent layout scaffolding: base layout + specialized layout
- Variable-driven CSS
- Minimal JS and progressively enhanced interactions
- Build-time CMS data fetching for speed
- Accessibility-first forms (labels, required markers, clear errors)

## What we applied to Job Club

- Build-time Sanity fetch for events/resources (with fallback)
- Pagination-based detail pages for events/resources
- Consent-gated analytics loader

## Next extraction candidates

- Add structured data for event pages
- Add sitemap and robots.txt
- Improve focus management for dialogs
