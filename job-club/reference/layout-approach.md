# Layout Approach (EAiKW Harvest)

## What to look for in EAiKW

- Layout composition (base layout + specialized layouts)
- Navigation consistency
- Reusable page sections and components

## Job Club status

- `layouts/base.njk` for main pages.
- `layouts/intro.njk` for the intro experience.
- Navigation is consistent via the mini cube menu.

## Remaining TODO

- Add consistent analytics tracking attributes to key CTAs.
- Ensure cookie banner appears on both base and intro layouts (done).
