EverydayAI Newark is a comprehensive AI training initiative designed to
democratize access to AI education while creating direct pathways between
students and corporate opportunities. As Director of the BS Enterprise AI
program at NJIT, I've seen firsthand the gap between what students learn and
what employers need. This program bridges that gap.

## Program Structure

### Free Community Training

  applications

- **Week 4**: Career Readiness - Resume building, interview prep, portfolio
  development

**Target Audience**: Newark residents, career changers, displaced workers,
students  
**Cost**: Completely free  
**Location**: Newark community centers, libraries, NJIT facilities  
**Commitment**: 2 hours/week for 4 weeks

workforce:

- 6-month career support post-placement

## Why This Matters

After 20+ years teaching at NJIT, creating 2 degree programs, and teaching
10,000+ students, I've seen the disconnect between education and employment.
Students graduate with skills but no network. Companies need talent but don't
know how to evaluate AI competency. Newark residents face barriers to entry.

EverydayAI Newark solves all three problems simultaneously.

### The Problem

- **Students**: Learn theory but struggle to land first job
- **Newark Residents**: Locked out of tech opportunities by geography and access
- **Companies**: Can't find qualified AI talent, don't know where to look

### The Solution

- **Free Training**: Remove financial barriers for Newark community
- **Corporate Revenue**: Fund sustainability through B2B training packages
- **Direct Connections**: Leverage my network to create real opportunities
- **Proven Curriculum**: Battle-tested content from teaching 10,000+ students

## Impact Metrics (Goals for Year 1)

- **100 Newark residents** trained through free community program
- **10 corporate clients** engaged for paid training packages
- **25 student placements** into full-time roles via Career Bridge
- **$100,000 revenue** from corporate training to sustain free programs
- **Monthly Town Halls** bringing together students, professionals, and
  community

## Monthly Town Hall Series

Central to the program is a monthly Town Hall event where:

- Industry professionals share real hiring needs and skills gaps
- Students present projects and get feedback from practitioners
- Community members learn about career pathways in AI
- Companies meet pre-vetted talent from our training programs

**First Town Hall**: January 9, 2026  
**Format**: Hybrid (in-person + LinkedIn Live)  
**Audience**: Students, professionals, Newark residents, corporate partners

## What Makes This Different

Most AI training programs are either:

1. **Too expensive** ($5,000+ bootcamps that exclude working-class students)
2. **Too theoretical** (university courses disconnected from industry needs)
3. **Too basic** ("AI 101" courses that don't lead to employment)

EverydayAI Newark combines:

- **Free access** funded by corporate training revenue
- **Practical skills** based on real employer needs
- **Direct connections** through my 1,837-person network
- **Proven track record** from 20+ years at NJIT

## Partnership Model

- **NJIT**: Academic credibility, facilities, student pipeline
- **Newark Community Centers**: Local reach, trust, accessibility
- **Corporate Partners**: Funding, hiring opportunities, curriculum input
- **My LinkedIn Network**: 1,837 connections across FAANG, finance, startups

## Timeline

- **November 2025**: Finalize curriculum, secure community center partnership
- **December 2025**: Corporate outreach, recruit Town Hall panelists
- **January 2026**: Launch first free community cohort + inaugural Town Hall
- **Q1 2026**: Onboard 3-5 corporate clients for paid training
- **Q2 2026**: First Career Bridge placements, evaluate and iterate

## Technical Foundation

The program leverages my experience:

- Creating BS Enterprise AI degree (300+ students enrolled)
- Developing MS Data Science program (200+ graduates)
- Teaching 8 core AI courses over 20 years
- CTO experience at startup (acquired by Anthem Ventures)
- International consulting (Zambia workforce development)

## Revenue Sustainability

**Year 1 Projection**:

- 5 corporate Starter packages ($2K × 5 = $10K)
- 3 corporate Professional packages ($5K × 3 = $15K)
- 1 corporate Enterprise package ($10K × 1 = $10K)
- **Total**: $35,000 (conservative estimate)

This covers:

- Free community training materials and space
- Career coaching and placement support
- Town Hall event costs
- Program administration

**Year 2-3 Goals**: Scale to 10-15 corporate clients, 200+ free community
participants, 50+ career placements

## Get Involved

- **Newark Residents**: Apply for free training (launching January 2026)
- **Companies**: Book corporate training or become hiring partner
- **Students**: Join Career Bridge program for placement support
- **Everyone**: Attend monthly Town Hall events

This isn't just a training program. It's a movement to democratize AI education
and create real economic opportunity in Newark.
