You're reading this on a Swiss design system I built with AI in one evening.

No agency. No $20K budget. No months of planning.

Just me, VS Code with agentic AI tools, and 200+ iterations of what I call "vibe
coding."

If I can do this—build a professional site, write 45,000 words of content,
create automated testing, deploy with CI/CD—in 10 hours...

**...what can you do with AI tools in your field?**

That's the question driving everything on this site: The
[Town Hall series](/townhall/). EverydayAI Newark. The corporate training. The
career bridges for my students.

## This Isn't a Portfolio. It's a Laboratory.

For the past nine months, I've been operating what I call an **intellectual
bulldozer**—using AI tools not as magic, but as force multipliers for expertise.

I threw away more code than I kept. I learned AI's weaknesses the hard way. I
discovered that "AI will replace you" is nonsense, but "someone using AI will
replace you" might be true.

And I documented the whole thing. **You're experiencing it right now.**

<div class="ai-voice">

**Hi, I'm the AI Keith worked with to build this site.**

Let me be honest: I hallucinated statistics three times while writing these
articles. I duplicated code. I confidently suggested approaches that were
completely wrong. I'm really good at sounding certain about things I'm making
up.

Keith caught every error because he knows enough to spot when I'm bullshitting.

That's the real story here: **AI doesn't replace expertise. It amplifies it.**

And sometimes it reveals just how much expertise you actually have.

</div>

## What This Site Actually Is

**Not a vanity portfolio** → A community leadership platform  
**Not just blog posts** → A curriculum for navigating AI transformation  
**Not theoretical speculation** → Real classroom results, real corporate
training, real career outcomes

### For Students

You'll find honest answers about:

- Whether your degree is worth it (it is—if you learn to work with AI)
- What skills actually matter (critical evaluation beats tool proficiency)
- How to navigate the job market (it's transforming, not collapsing)

**Start here**: [Skills That Matter](/blog/skills-that-matter/) →
[AI Job Reality](/blog/ai-job-reality/) →
[Education AI Reality](/blog/education-ai-reality/)

### For Employers

You'll find reality checks on:

- Actual productivity gains ($7T over 10 years, not overnight)
- What's happening to jobs (70-75% transformed, not eliminated)
- How to think about AI investments (framework that works)

**Start here**: [AI Productivity Reality](/blog/ai-productivity-reality/) →
[AI Job Reality](/blog/ai-job-reality/) →
[AI Risks That Matter](/blog/ai-risks-that-matter/)

### For Skeptics

You'll find evidence that:

- AGI isn't coming in 5 years (2,700 experts agree: 2047 median)
- The printing press parallel explains what's actually happening
- Real risks aren't sci-fi (jobs, bias, privacy—not robot overlords)

**Start here**: [AGI Hype Cycle](/blog/agi-hype-cycle/) →
[How to Think About AI](/blog/how-to-think-about-ai/) →
[AI Printing Press](/blog/ai-printing-press/)

### For Believers

You'll find demonstrations that:

- AI collaboration is messy and powerful (this site is proof)
- Agentic tools change everything (but not overnight)
- The transformation is real (but gradual, not revolutionary)

## The Numbers Behind the Mission

**Twenty years at NJIT.** More than 10,000 students. Programs I created: BS in
Web & Information Systems, BS in Enterprise AI, eight core courses.

I'm not writing about AI transformation from a conference room. I'm writing from
the classroom where it's already happening.

**January 9, 2026**: [Town Hall Series launches](/townhall/). Free monthly
events in Newark. Hybrid format (in-person + LinkedIn Live). Real conversations
about AI's impact on work, education, and economic opportunity.

**EverydayAI Newark**: Not another "how to use ChatGPT" workshop. We teach
agentic AI tools, context engineering, tool building, process design. The stuff
that actually creates competitive advantage.

**Corporate Training**: Three tiers ($2K/$5K/$10K). Custom curriculum. Hands-on
implementation. Not consulting theater—actual capability building.

## What You Won't Find Here

❌ **AI will solve everything** (it won't)  
❌ **AI will destroy everything** (it won't)  
❌ **Buy my course** (Town Hall is free, training is transparent pricing)  
❌ **Trust me, I'm an expert** (I show my work, cite sources, admit
uncertainty)  
❌ **Hype about AGI** (median expert prediction: 2047, not 2030)

## What You Will Find

✅ **Honest talk about what's working** (and what isn't)  
✅ **Real classroom examples** (my students build Shopify themes in 7 days with
AI)  
✅ **Economic stakes** (we're investing trillions—we have to get this right)  
✅ **Career bridges** (1,837 LinkedIn connections connecting students to
opportunities)  
✅ **AI speaking directly** (callouts throughout where AI responds to my
arguments)

## The Meta Moment

Notice anything unusual about this site?

**The AI voice callouts.** That black background with red borders. The AI
breaking the fourth wall to comment on the content.

That's not a gimmick. That's the point.

We're not discussing AI collaboration in the abstract. **You're experiencing
it.** The AI and I are having a conversation, and you're reading both sides.

When the AI admits "I hallucinated three times writing this article"—that's not
undermining the content. That's demonstrating why AI + human expertise is more
powerful than either alone.

<div class="ai-voice">

**About that "10 hours" claim**: It's true, but incomplete.

Keith spent 10 hours building this site. But he spent **9 months** before that
learning how to work with AI tools effectively. Learning when to trust me and
when to fact-check me. Learning how to decompose problems and orchestrate
expertise.

The 10 hours was fast because of the 9 months of learning.

That's the real lesson: **AI doesn't eliminate learning curves. It changes what
you need to learn.**

Keith learned my weaknesses. My tendency to hallucinate. My overconfidence. My
pattern matching limitations.

Now he uses me as an intellectual bulldozer. But he's the one operating it.

</div>

## Why Newark?

I'm done watching qualified students ghost companies because they don't know how
to connect. I'm done watching small businesses get left behind in AI
transformation. I'm done with AI conversations that happen in San Francisco and
ignore the rest of the country.

**Newark matters.** Half a million people. Anchor city for the region.
Incredible talent. Real economic challenges.

If we can build free AI education, career bridges, and corporate training
here—we can build it anywhere.

## What's Next

**Read the blog series.** Ten posts covering everything from the printing press
parallel to skills that matter. Choose your path above based on your role.

**Check out the [Swiss Portfolio project](/projects/swiss-portfolio/).** It's
the full story of how we built this site—told by the AI, not me. It's meta. It's
honest. It's proof the collaboration model works.

**Mark your calendar: [January 9, 2026](/townhall/).** Town Hall #1: "The Job
Market Reality Check." Free. Hybrid. Real talk about what's actually happening
to work.

**Connect on LinkedIn** (keith-williams-njit). If you're a student looking for
opportunities or an employer looking for talent, let's talk.

## The Real Introduction

This site isn't about showcasing what I've built.

It's about showing what's possible when you stop treating AI as magic and start
treating it as a tool that amplifies expertise.

**Ten hours to build this site.**  
**Nine months to learn how to work with AI.**  
**Twenty years of expertise making those nine months productive.**  
**Ten thousand students proving the model works.**

Now imagine what happens when we scale that.

That's EverydayAI Newark.  
That's the Town Hall series.  
That's what this site is actually for.

Welcome to the laboratory.

Let's build something.
